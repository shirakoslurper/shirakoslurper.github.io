# Starting the blog

I wanted to establish a single place to aggregate my interests and put them out in the "open".

I also wanted a place where I could practice condensing my thoughts so I can hold onto them for longer and better communicate them.

At the moment, I am:
- learning Japanese
- watching an unhealthy (?) amount of anime
- refining my restaurant search techniques
- developing a perspective on food
- learning the basics of cooking
- wondering what to do with unemployment
- trying to score a 177+ on the LSAT
- reaching for professional illustrator level
