# Shiro-Ebi Mizubun 白えび水文

I had a bit of a mackerel (鯖) dilemma recently. 

I wanted to recreate [Restaurant Beba](https://restaurantbeba.ca/en/)'s [montaditos topped with cured mackerel](https://www.instagram.com/p/CoDhXGbrw4R/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==), but after having tried and determined a bagel dough recipe to be good enough (not too picky as a home cook - my skills are limited), I faced the issue of sourcing fish.

I thought I'd cure my own mackerel. However, though we on the West Coast have access to the same species of Pacific Mackerel as they do in Japan ([*scomber japonicus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chub_mackerel)), it's hard to find mackerel that you'd be comfortable eating raw outside of the mass-produced somewhat vinegar-heavy and pungent shime-saba you'd get at the local Japanese markets. I believe it's classic fare for homemade lunchbox-style sushi but not what I was looking for. 

It makes sense. There's a lot working against having quality raw pacific mackerel in the States:

- Demand: Mackerel doesn't fit the palate of most stateside folk, though it's a staple in many other cultures. 
- Processing: With little demand for mackerel in the first place and little emphasis placed on quality, mackerel isn't babied - well bled, gutted, iced, and perhaps ike & shinkei-jimed (though most mackerel even in Japan is left to die in ice - though I suspect the stuff intended for raw consumption is more delicately dealth with).
- Natural spoilage: Mackerel has the tendency to spoil and get fishy quickly. Coupled with poor processing, even mackerel that makes it to the ports quickly after being landed could be less than ideal.
- FDA Regulations: Fish sold *for* raw consumption in the U.S. must be superfrozen to comply with FDA regulations, else the burden of proof that a fish is safe to eat raw lies on the seller (research they typically cannot afford).

My best bet would be to hit the docks, settle on the most quality-obsessed fisherman bartering mackerel available, and roll the die on the fish.

Either that or spend 50 bucks / lb on the stuff from Toyosu via Yama. + shipping.

This inconvenience had me thinking about how nice it would be for a local business to focus solely on *producing* (from catch to sale) high quality, FDA compliant, easily accessible (deals with local Asian grocery chains a la HMart, Tokyo Central, 99 Ranch) intendednt-for-raw-consumption mackerel. And make a living off the single product alone (it's a staple innit - and word gets around certain Asian communities fast regarding food products). And packaging the product nicely, too. Perhaps running a sakana-ya a la [Osakana NYC](https://osakana.nyc) for extra local brownie points.

Needless to say, I've been orbiting the idea of single product sourcing and processing.

And as this thought floated around in my head, I came across [@shiroebi_mizubun](https://www.instagram.com/shiroebi_mizubun?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw==) on Instagram - a company based out of Toyama, Japan dedicated to producing a single raw local product - Toyama Bay (富山湾) Shiro-Ebi (白えび) for [retail consumption](https://anshindo-d.com/c/shop_category/shop_seafood/shop_seafood_sea/286/28600001).

I'll give a truncated description since their background is best covered on their [site](https://mizubun.co.jp) and in this [article](https://gyoson.suisan-shinkou.or.jp/interview/vol47.html):

- Shiro-Ebi Mizubun (白えび水文) is the retail brand under Mizubun (水文), the only white shrimp specialty store in Toyama Bay.
- While Shiro-Ebi Mizubun's sales started in the 2025 and it's first HAACP certified factory was established in 2022, Mizubun has been around for longer producing white shrimp sashimi for businesses (restaurant use).
- It came about as the peeling process was discovered due to the propagation of freezing technology - by coincidence it was discovered that freezing and thawing left gaps between the shells and the meat (due toe differing freezing rates) that allowed for the raw meat to be separated from the shells more easily. Freezing is done at -25C (lower temperature don't separate the meat from the shell as well as the whole unit freeezes too quickly).
- Mizubun transitioned from a half-and-half sashimi production and shrimp brokering to full sashimi production in 2004.
- Mizubun peels all shrimps by hand instead of machine to preserve texture, flavor, and color.
- Mizubun has been selling to a major conveyor belt chain since about 2018 - they aim more for the ikura and uni category.
- Mizubun's discarded shells have been used to make crackers and other flavored goods.
- Mizubun does sell whole shrimp, but sashimi makes up 90% of their sales.
- Mizubun plans to expand globally this year.

I'm sure there's a lot of press shine to the information I could get, but it's an interesting niche and approach: focusing on the production and distribution of a single process-sensitive hyperlocal product and targeting an expanding middle high-end market.

Also interesting is the [accessibility](https://anshindo-d.com/c/shop_category/shop_seafood/shop_seafood_sea) of quality seafood in Japan. You can even [order some spiffy lookin fish on Amazon](https://youtu.be/FeV8Bn91AQc?si=49U_xVc7OAqwVNcv) there.

I'd like to get my hands on Shiro-Ebi Mizubun's products in the States out of curiosity (it's a rare find even in high-end sushi-yas). I suspect Regalis or Sakasyu or Yama Seafoods will be the first to get their hands on the product. Perhaps even Yokose Seafood due to his Toyama Bay connections.

> As for, "what makes is special"? A single product seafood busiess isn't unique - we've got overnight oysters in the U.S. - but something about the relative volatility of the product + the lack of a widespread global retail market for it atm is intriguing.
