# Tuesday's Sushi-ish Menu

Some pre-planning.

I'm going to get my hands on some fish.

Options are: 
- Masaba (Chub Mackerel)
- Aji (Horse Mackerel)
- Buri (Yellowtail)
- Kamasu (Barracuda)
- Sawara (Spanish Mackerel)
- Aka Ika (Swordtip Squid)
- Ama Ebi (Pandalus Borealis)
- Tai (Japanese Sea Bream)

Got to get a fairly small amount.
And not take on *too* much prep.

I think about 3 different fish is reasonable.

Buri season is *just* ending so we should grab some if we can.
We can do sashimi and buri daikon / buri shabu. I think buri shabu is a better option for good fish.

I've been wanting to make shime-saba with the saba so I feel like that's non negotiable?
This can be fairly versatile.

And I also think Kamasu would be a winner. Seared.

Perhaps some ama-ebi, too...

As for rice, I think some Sasanishiki or something adjacent (Sasashigure?). 
Maybe Shiga Mizukagami rice with less water. A light sweetness since I want to go no-sugar with the rice.
Tokyo Central holds Nanatsuboshi and Akitakomachi.
