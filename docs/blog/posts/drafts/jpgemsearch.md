# Finding Gems in Japan

> I haven't eaten at the "gems" I've found but my brother has.

Where was my starting point?

It was FoodTalkCentral. Not Reddit, which is the where many people first turn to.

> Reddit is accessible and it has dedicated forums to fine dining. However, the opinions I tend to look for are those that tend to stand the test of time and education. Those that hold up the more you learn about food. The ones that send you places you appreciate more over time, rather than less. Those that come from people with stronger opinions on what honest good food means. An while I'm sure Reddit has a couple of these people, a good chunk of the diners tend to come before the first peak on Le Dunning Kruger curve.

The self-selecting groups that end up on the post-Chowhound forums tend to be more knowledgeable (possibly snobby). FoodTalkCentral seems to be a bit more hardass than HungryOnion, though.

> Higher hit rate. Am not made out of money.

My other starting point was through the socials of chefs and food industry professionals. When I was eating my way around Montreal, I made a point of making my way through the social webs of the local food scene.

Follow restaurants.
Follow chefs.
View tags and look for opinionated diners.

Restaurant Beba's account (which I deeply regret cancelling my reservation at) was a goldmine in terms of attracting strong opinions.
The account is run with no filter by the chef.
Deeply "gastronomic" in a way.
And it's caviar distributors seemd quite opinioated, too.

You then make your way arounf those opinion networks and note all the restaurants they deem worth going, too.

> Higher hit rate when they some thing like "x restaurant is one of the few restaurants on the continent cooking at a high-level".
