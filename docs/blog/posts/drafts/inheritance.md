# Inhertiance and the Burden of Starting Anew

Why cook new things?
There's a million delicious things already.
Hundreds vand thousands of years of culinary heritage at your fingertips, in libraries, in bookstores, vocalized, written on card, accessible via Google translate, etc.

You don't need to put gochujang in a cookie because someone at the New York Times told you to.
You haven't made the best chocolate chip cookie possible yet.
You haven't even gotten tired of chocolate ship cookies.
But a gochujang cookie is the first thing on your mind when you think cookie cause it's been stamped into your skull somehow.

Then there are jobs. It feels as if lineage in a profession is a dead thing, now. There are few crafts to inherit. There are few mentorships thats are not mercenary. There's no dream carried from a generation to the nest - only the tidbits required to extract money.
