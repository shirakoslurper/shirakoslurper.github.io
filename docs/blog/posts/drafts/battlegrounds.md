# 3 sushi battlegrounds and intuition

The following are some takeaways from reading [sushilog](https://www.sushi-blog.com).

> I quite like sushilog's expressed view on sushi. He's grounded in tradition, very value conscious (but wary of words like "cost-performance"), and an advocate for underdogs doing things with the right intention. That's how critics should be. He's also capable of being critical, which I find many online enthusiasts are not.

I'm gathering that the 3 main battlegrounds of sushi in Japan are:
- Tokyo (naturally - the "Edo" in Edomae is Tokyo)
- Hokkaido
- Fukuoka

While the "sushi bubble" seems to be a nation-wide phenomenon, it seems to be especially prounounced in Tokyo.

Prices soar higher, margins become tighter, and there's a sort of sameness and coldness that's permeates a growing percentage of the cities restaurants. But that's the sort of thing that happens when a trend starts to eat itself.

> The sameness isn't just a vibe thing. As operational efficiency gets optimized on the distribution front, more and more chefs end up sourcing the same product from the same distributors. Locality matters less and less - even chefs from the areas products are produced often have to buy back from Toyosu.

Conceptually, Hokkaido's scene seems the most compelling.

> I'm an outsider trusting word of mouth.

The backgrounds of many chefs are untraditional and/or not as prestigious as those in Tokyo, but there seems to be a spirit of craft that's taking root. It's the sort of thing that allows for 5 years of training starting at the ripe old sushi age of 27 to be sufficient to start a restaurant and pump out elite sushi.

> There's quite an emphasis on lineage and prestife in the Tokyo scene that's not as conducive to this, I think.

In short, the sushiyas are extremely personal and the individuality of the voices come through along with quality. Chefs make a point of sourcing directly from local fishermen and fishmongers. They (more) eschew the dynamics that threaten to pull the Tokyo scene into limbo.

> As long as the work strain is manageable - I'm a big proponent of one person, husband-wife shops.

So basically, emphasis on:
- craft
- quality
- personal/functional authenticity

> The less the last quality is teased out of proprietors, the better. It's a sort of natural anti-saturation mechanism. "Functional" meaning that the restaurant knows exactly what it's meant to be and it's constraints and doesn't walk outside of those boundaries. This isn't a call for deliberate individualism, however, though that might seem unintuitive. Ex: the above considered together would emphasize using the highest quality local ingredients (given availability) and a well-adapted approach to those ingredients with the character of local markets and its people in mind. And since sushi is about the micro, even the smallest differences in a chef's character - clearly conveyed - come through with significant impact.

An aside:
Although I've mentioned the merits of hyperspecific and/or traditional cuisines, one thing I haven't mentioned is a certain burden it lifts from the shoulders of chefs. Individuality doesn't have to aspired to. When diners' scales adjust, naturally differences come through. It's easier said than done, however, and the idea of "canonical" cuisine can be misinterpreted as needing to be the basis of this. Ex: If chefs feel, x ingredient is considered important but is strained and comes at a higher cost, then I feel that it's a sign to explore. A la going to underutilized fish.

> Forcing the use of "underutilized" and "local" produce doesn't yield the best results, however, when quality is lacking. As always, n + 1 is the most reliable approach. A la, "this fish is caught and processed with the same attention to detail, is affordable, and is delicious but is avoided by chefs due to extra labor". Or "this is the same species that is valued abroad but isn't treated with reverence here, but I can establish a relationship with a fisherman and get it processed as I wish for a fair cost".
