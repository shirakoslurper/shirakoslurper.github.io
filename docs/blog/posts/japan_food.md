# Some thoughts while researching restaurants in Japan

You have to put in a bit more legwork when you're not plugged into the food scene (industry connections) and have a more limited budget to work with.

I like to look for simple, delicious, slightly strange, and highly personal food. + a bit of underdogicity. And for chefs who, by cooking what they love, are making a case for the merits of something wonderful as it exists. 

> Ex: A sushi chef who wants to highlight less appreciated fish he believes are deilcious and puts in the extra time processing and offering at a low cost. Some dude in Japan uncompromisingly cooking a lesser-known regional Italian cuisine who doesn't want any reviews uploaded to preserve the goodness of food, spirit, and atmosphere.

> This can go a couple of ways, however. There's a difference between being a genuine ambassador for something and trying to reframe something as novel. The latter often leads to retreading hundreds of years of history in a lab and acting as if you've invented fermentation, or to sleazyhyper commercialised regional Italian restaurants filled with egos an Italian mother couldn't love. To each their own, but those sort of things don't tickle my fancy.

> There's also feigned rusticism. Kind of have a soft spot for these spots cause they're slick and a good time - but I think truly earnest is best. If the chef is a born and bred Orientalist and can't get it out of his blood, fine. If he'll die on that hill, even better. Because it's trendy? Nope. Prestigious? Nope.

Also I like when I have to put in little effort to appreciate what's happening. Why not learn when you're drowning in information anyways.

> I don't think I'd appreciate life on easy ignorant mode a la $300+ sushi omakases every day for two weeks and concluding "they're all about the same since the fish is always fresh."

As for how I conduct research.

For a higher hit rate, you need some very opinionated people. These often happen to be people to be people in the industry - cooks and distributors. The latter tend to have more consistent uploading schedules (figures) and more overt nerding out (long winded explanations with strongly held opinions) but I trust cooks more when It comes to measuring how soul-nuorishing a place is. It can be a little grating at times but the kid who's obsessed with trains and "overexplains" with gusto and holds areligious dedication to certain train construction philosophies to the chagrin of other people can probably be relied on to pick a good one. Or at least one you can learn to appreciate. And to be right in the long run. Choo choo.

As for local food scenes, you can bet on one of the whales who pin the locations of top sushiyas in the cities you visit to be a person born and bred of that city. There are some who refuse to non-whale on the timeline but a couple mix high and low - and regardless there are couple true genre enthusiasts in the whale category who exhaust the high-end and climb down the dollar/yen rungs to the lower bound of the high cost performance gems among them. Gold for us commoners.

Also, chefs follow chefs, and distributors are fairly reliable for their tastes - though cross referencing never hurts. 

> Chefs following chefs is especially reliable for genre based food. And It's useful when you're hunting down a place you don't know the name of.

You can fall back on enthusiast forums and Tabelog but tis more about quality than the je nais se quoi of a place.
