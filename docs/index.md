## bio

CS Grad and art school transfer-out who hasn't got a hold of things, yet.

> Disclaimer: The following is non-exhaustive. Everything on this website is.

## projects:

- [arbisui: Sui DEX Arbitrage Bot](https://github.com/shirakoslurper/arbisui)
    - this is really hefty
    - gonna write more about this (?)
- [Move Bytecode to Expansion AST Converter](https://github.com/shirakoslurper/move/tree/main/language/move-bytecode-prover)
    - this was interesting to do


## doohickies:

- [OpenTable Experience Reservation Bot](https://github.com/shirakoslurper/tablehog)
- [SankoChain New Pair Sniper Bot](https://github.com/shirakoslurper/skyper)


## skills + familiar Tech:

- Rust: 
    - more than proficient
    - wrote arbisui and other bots in this
    - promise I write more cleanly when there's no scrapping for digital pennies on the line
    - cleanest project is private due to Anheuser Busch's confidentiality agreements with the students
- C++: 
    - proficient
    - did most my LeetCode in this
- Sui Move:
    - proficient
    - wrote the transaction scripts for arbisui in this
    - due to writing the Bytcode to AST Converter, have a deeper understanding of Move compilation than most (need a bit of a memory jog, though)
- Sui Stack:
    - familiar with pretty much everything in terms of interacting with the chain
    - wrote custom tooling for the Rust client to allow transaction chaining (pretty in the trenches, I'd say)
    - wrote parsing tools for Sui data
    - lot more I can't remember off the top of my head
- JavasScript/TypeScript: 
    - proficient-ish 
    - enough to scrap together a limited image editor frontend with in React
    - would not teach people because I have bad form
- React: 
    - proficient-ish
    - for an suspended desktop app project - frontend works, but it ain't super pretty
    - would not teach people because I have bad form
- Tauri (Rust, React): 
    - proficient-ish
    - was building the suspended desktop app project with this
- JSON-RPC: 
    - enough to interact with it 
    - heavily utilized in arbisui (transaction endpoint)
- GraphQL: 
    - enough to query
    - used in a upgraded version of arbisui in a private repo and the Opentable Experience Reservation Bot


## familiar domains-ish:

- reservation botting + checkout: 
    - API Reverse Engineering
    - web scraping
    - automating checkout processes
- VHDL & Verilog: 
    - for a computer engineering class, woohoo
- Web3 & the like: 
    - implemented versions of Uni V2 & V3 for arbitrage simulation and volume optimization purposes
    - deep-ish Sui knowledge
    - fairly decent knowledge of general trading basics given the arbitrage bot
    - just was generally kind of into the scene tech-wise for better or worse :/
