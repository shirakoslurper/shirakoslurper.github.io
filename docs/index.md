## bio

CS Grad and art school transfer-out who hasn't got a hold of things, yet.

> Disclaimer: The following is non-exhaustive. Everything on this website is.

## projects:

- [arbisui: Sui DEX Arbitrage Bot](https://github.com/shirakoslurper/arbisui)
    - this is really hefty
    - gonna write more about this (?)
- [Move Bytecode to Expansion AST Converter](https://github.com/shirakoslurper/move/tree/main/language/move-bytecode-prover)
    - this was interesting to do


## doohickies:

- [OpenTable Experience Reservation Bot](https://github.com/shirakoslurper/tablehog)
- [SankoChain New Pair Sniper Bot](https://github.com/shirakoslurper/skyper)


## skills + familiar Tech:

- Rust: 
    - more than proficient
    - wrote arbisui and other bots in this
    - promise I write more cleanly when there's no scrapping for digital pennies on the line
    - cleanest project is private due to Anheuser Busch's confidentiality agreements with the students
- C++: 
    - proficient
    - did most my LeetCode in this
- Sui Move:
    - proficient
    - wrote the transaction scripts for arbisui in this
    - due to writing the Bytcode to AST Converter, have a deeper understanding of Move compilation than most (need a bit of a memory jog, though)
- Sui Stack:
    - familiar with pretty much everything in terms of interacting with the chain
    - wrote custom tooling for the Rust client to allow transaction chaining (pretty in the trenches, I'd say)
    - wrote parsing tools for Sui data
    - lot more I can't remember off the top of my head
- JavasScript/TypeScript: 
    - proficient-ish 
    - enough to scrap together a limited image editor frontend with in React
    - would not teach people because I have bad form
- React: 
    - proficient-ish
    - for an suspended desktop app project - frontend works, but it ain't super pretty
    - would not teach people because I have bad form
- Tauri (Rust, React): 
    - proficient-ish
    - was building the suspended desktop app project with this
- JSON-RPC: 
    - enough to interact with it 
    - heavily utilized in arbisui (transaction endpoint)
- GraphQL: 
    - enough to query
    - used in a upgraded version of arbisui in a private repo and the Opentable Experience Reservation Bot


## familiar domains-ish:

- reservation botting + checkout: 
    - API Reverse Engineering
    - web scraping
    - automating checkout processes
- VHDL & Verilog: 
    - for a computer engineering class, woohoo
- Web3 & the like: 
    - implemented versions of Uni V2 & V3 for arbitrage simulation and volume optimization purposes
    - deep-ish Sui knowledge
    - fairly decent knowledge of general trading basics given the arbitrage bot
    - just was generally kind of into the scene tech-wise for better or worse :/

        - dongbei-style korean bbq (a la xita laotaitai) - would expect to see much more of this is in the u.s. given its popularity in china. we've got yanbian style bbq skewers in the u.s., though, like feng mao in koreatown la. love korea disapora foods.
        - the industrialization and homogenization of korean food - korean still made soy sauce at home for decades after japan and china deferred to industrial practices (the methods of making soy sauce were more conducive to them and were better done at scale), and even after the industrial soy sauce became available. however, now the majority of korean soy sauce contains hydrolyzed vegetable proteins while japan managed to phase them out of their soy sauces (for the most part).
        - [korean traditional knowledge portal](https://koreantk.com): for older agricultural + food knowledge. so many variations on doenjang. also a lot of regional foods.
        - [mike colameco's real food show](https://www.youtube.com/@MikeColamecosRealFoodShow): when you're exploring a restaurant scene it's good to explore what it was like before your time. it's all chefs talk about on podacast lmao. tracing lineages and tracking developments helps you develop some intuition when choosing what to keep your eye on and where to eat.
        - [eating in translation](https://www.eatingintranslation.com): lovely for tracking food events in new york and ethnic foods

        - [eattheworldnyc](http://www.eattheworldnyc.com) and [eattheworldla](http://www.eattheworldla.com): jared cohee does excellent work
        - [eat something new in queens](https://www.facebook.com/groups/228217388961700/): also in the name. when you compare this and something like foodtalkcentral, you kind of realize how much class plays a part in food (the social media that people use is very indicative of class) but also how a love for food and a will to learn about it isn't restricted to those that make a little more お金. a huge chunk of americans might still only have the bear and the menu as a point of reference (often to the point of annoyance for some), but you can learn tons about food (and even more about culture) in conversation with the immigrant proprietors of much more affordable restaurants who tend to be significantly less removed from food as it was (and often is intended to be in restaurants). knowledge about seasonality, quality ingredients, treating those ingredients with respect... (sometimes not immediately apparent in the food they sell - they have to hit a balance of authenticity and marketability out her and are often limited produce wise).

        - [max shapiro](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/air-jordan-a-food-podcast/id1437334078&ved=2ahUKEwiIp8bE3b-OAxUmEFkFHRZtEZAQFnoECB8QAQ&usg=AOvVaw3VLVC7PVXnLeEtTbMI2G3o): good chemistry. also good balance of informative and fun. good to hear someone with strong opinions. max can come off a bit snobby til you realize he puts the ethnic stuff in a difference category and will absolutely put down some cabeza (eyes and everything).
