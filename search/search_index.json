An acccesibility thing perhaps? Popularity? I wonder which saying came first and which enthusiast circle they respectively guide.</p> <p>Anyways, with the reverence of tea culture and tea culture history in Japan + the Korean ceramics intertwined roots of the Mingei movement, there seems to have been fertile ground to produce artists who look to Korean techniques and styles and strive to faithfully recreate them.</p> <p>My entry point was Hosokawa Morihiro (coincidentally a former Prime Minister of Japan) who strived to make works inspired by the Momoyama Period and the Korean Joseon Dynasty Period.</p> <p>His mentors and inspirations included: - Tsujimura Shiro who dedicated much of his life to Ido chawan. - Togo Kobayashi finds inspiration in Yi Dynasty ceramics, even establishing a kiln on Tsushima Island for the seclusion and clay which is reportedly as close as it gets to Korean clay on Japanese territory. </p> <p>Shoutout e-yakimono.</p> <p>Hosting collections by further artists inspired by Korean wares is Gallery Ichibankan, as one of the directors has a personal interest in Joseon wares:</p> <ul> <li>Shintaro Uchimura: Joseon dynasty inspired ans karatsu wares</li> <li>Takesue Hiomi: a student of Togo Kobayashi, also on Tsushima island producing Joseon dynasty inspired wares</li> <li>Munehiko Maruta: produced Ido-inspired and Karatsu ware</li> <li>Yasumoto Kajiwars: produces old Karatsu and holds and interesy in ancient Korean pottery</li> </ul> <p>Note: The line between inspired by ancient Korean wares and old Karatsu and other Korean lineage styles can get blurry. Ceramicists are students of the craft and pull from multiple inspirations. Also the naming is throwing me off a bit for some stuff but I'll just have to educate myself a bit more.

Not Reddit, which is the where many people first turn to.</p> <p>Reddit is accessible and it has dedicated forums to fine dining and the L.A. food scene. However, the opinions I tend to look for are those that tend to stand the test of time and education. Those that hold up the more you learn about food. The ones that send you places you appreciate more over time, rather than less. Those that come from people with stronger opinions on what honest good food means. Reddit can feel a little diluted in this regard. I like having a higher hit rate, since my folks aren't made of money.</p> <p>The self-selecting groups that end up on the post-Chowhound forums tend to be more knowledgeable (possibly snobby). Also, FoodTalkCentral seems to be a bit more hardass than HungryOnion, which feels like a plus. It's not the most active place on the interwebs, as it has a fairly low number of regular users, but it has a regularly beating pulse and tends to be ahead of the curve.</p> <p>My other starting point is the socials of chefs and food industry professionals (especially wholesalers and distributors). When I was eating my way around Montreal, I made a point of making my way through the social graphs of the local food scene.</p> <p>Follow restaurants. Follow chefs. View tags and snarky inside joke comments from fellow chefs and look for opinionated independent diners. Reviewers associated with the local press can be pretty well-connected and knowledgeable but I get the feeling that their prioritization of neutrality and the publishing of regular content gets in the way of good direction.</p> <p>Ex: Restaurant Beba's account (which I deeply regret cancelling my reservation at) was a goldmine in terms of attracting strong opinions. The account is run with no filter by the chef. It's deeply \"gastronomic\" in a way. And it's caviar distributors seem quite opinionated, too.</p> <p>You then make your way around those opinion networks and note all the restaurants they deem worth going. Especially for places abroad - you'll often find some places with minimal information on the internet otherwise. It's as close to word-of-mouth as you can get while being antisocial - they've got friends and fixers you don't.</p> <p>Higher hit rate when they say something like \"x restaurant is one of the few restaurants on the continent cooking at a high-level\".</p>","tags":["food"]},{"location":"blog/2025/02/24/rice-sources/","title":"Rice Sources","text":"<p>Some decent online sources of rice:</p> <ul> <li>The Rice Factory New York/The Rice Factory Los Angeles: Honolulu spin-off.

However, though we on the West Coast have access to the same species of Pacific Mackerel as they do in Japan (scomber japonicus), it's hard to find mackerel that you'd be comfortable eating raw outside of the mass-produced somewhat vinegar-heavy and pungent shime-saba you'd get at the local Japanese markets. I believe it's classic fare for homemade lunchbox-style sushi but not what I was looking for. </p> <p>It makes sense. There's a lot working against having quality raw pacific mackerel in the States:</p> <ul> <li>Demand: Mackerel doesn't fit the palate of most stateside folk, though it's a staple in many other cultures. </li> <li>Processing: With little demand for mackerel in the first place and little emphasis placed on quality, mackerel isn't babied - well bled, gutted, iced, and perhaps ike &amp; shinkei-jimed (though most mackerel even in Japan is left to die in ice - though I suspect the stuff intended for raw consumption is more delicately dealth with).</li> <li>Natural spoilage: Mackerel has the tendency to spoil and get fishy quickly. Coupled with poor processing, even mackerel that makes it to the ports quickly after being landed could be less than ideal.</li> <li>FDA Regulations: Fish sold for raw consumption in the U.S. must be superfrozen to comply with FDA regulations, else the burden of proof that a fish is safe to eat raw lies on the seller (research they typically cannot afford).</li> </ul> <p>My best bet would be to hit the docks, settle on the most quality-obsessed fisherman bartering mackerel available, and roll the die on the fish.</p> <p>Either that or spend 50 bucks / lb on the stuff from Toyosu via Yama. + shipping.</p> <p>This inconvenience had me thinking about how nice it would be for a local business to focus solely on producing (from catch to sale) high quality, FDA compliant, easily accessible (deals with local Asian grocery chains a la HMart, Tokyo Central, 99 Ranch) intendednt-for-raw-consumption mackerel. And make a living off the single product alone (it's a staple innit - and word gets around certain Asian communities fast regarding food products). And packaging the product nicely, too. Perhaps running a sakana-ya a la Osakana NYC for extra local brownie points.</p> <p>Needless to say, I've been orbiting the idea of single product sourcing and processing.</p> <p>And as this thought floated around in my head, I came across @shiroebi_mizubun on Instagram - a company based out of Toyama, Japan dedicated to producing a single raw local product - Toyama Bay (\u5bcc\u5c71\u6e7e) Shiro-Ebi (\u767d\u3048\u3073) for retail consumption.</p> <p>I'll give a truncated description since their background is best covered on their site and in this article:</p> <ul> <li>Shiro-Ebi Mizubun (\u767d\u3048\u3073\u6c34\u6587) is the retail brand under Mizubun (\u6c34\u6587), the only white shrimp specialty store in Toyama Bay.</li> <li>While Shiro-Ebi Mizubun's sales started in the 2025 and it's first HAACP certified factory was established in 2022, Mizubun has been around for longer producing white shrimp sashimi for businesses (restaurant use).</li> <li>It came about as the peeling process was discovered due to the propagation of freezing technology - by coincidence it was discovered that freezing and thawing left gaps between the shells and the meat (due toe differing freezing rates) that allowed for the raw meat to be separated from the shells more easily. Freezing is done at -25C (lower temperature don't separate the meat from the shell as well as the whole unit freeezes too quickly).</li> <li>Mizubun transitioned from a half-and-half sashimi production and shrimp brokering to full sashimi production in 2004.</li> <li>Mizubun peels all shrimps by hand instead of machine to preserve texture, flavor, and color.</li> <li>Mizubun has been selling to a major conveyor belt chain since about 2018 - they aim more for the ikura and uni category.</li> <li>Mizubun's discarded shells have been used to make crackers and other flavored goods.</li> <li>Mizubun does sell whole shrimp, but sashimi makes up 90% of their sales.</li> <li>Mizubun plans to expand globally this year.</li> </ul> <p>I'm sure there's a lot of press shine to the information I could get, but it's an interesting niche and approach: focusing on the production and distribution of a single process-sensitive hyperlocal product and targeting an expanding middle high-end market.</p> <p>Also interesting is the accessibility of quality seafood in Japan. You can even order some spiffy lookin fish on Amazon there.</p> <p>I'd like to get my hands on Shiro-Ebi Mizubun's products in the States out of curiosity (it's a rare find even in high-end sushi-yas). I suspect Regalis or Sakasyu or Yama Seafoods will be the first to get their hands on the product. Perhaps even Yokose Seafood due to his Toyama Bay connections.</p> <p>As for, \"what makes is special\"? A single product seafood busiess isn't unique - we've got overnight oysters in the U.S. - but something about the relative volatility of the product + the lack of a widespread global retail market for it atm is intriguing.</p>","tags":["sourcing","food","japan"]},{"location":"blog/2025/02/20/notes-on-sourcing-japanese-fish/","title":"Notes on Sourcing Japanese Fish in the States as a Home Chef","text":"<p>The most involved sushi nerds in the states tend not to compromise on wild Japanese fish.</p> <p>So, generally a hard pass on the likes of the non-Japanese origin and/or farmed fish which are generally what the more budget-minded r/sushi folks reach for:</p> <ul> <li>Riviera Seafood Club</li> <li>Honolulu Fish Company</li> <li>Catalina Offshore Products</li> </ul> <p>It's not easy to get your hands on hand-selected imported Japanese seafood for a non-eyewatering price, though.

Also, depending on where you are, some pickup only spots may be available.</p> <p>A little resourcesfulness in searching, however, gets us to globally shipped Japanese fish for a relative discount. These typically are born from smaller U.S. importers/distributors working with smaller Japanese wholesaling operations out of more obscure ports hoping to establish some presence in the global market. I've even read of chefs working with a dude or two on the grounds at Kyushu fish markets.</p> <p>I'm not entirely sure about the quality of fish compared to those that come through Toyosu - are these wholesalers getting first pick? </p> <p>A good number of restaurants in Japan selling local ingredients actually have to \"buy back\" from Toyosu, since it's such a critical and overwhelmingly dominant distribution hub. There are a select few restaurants where this isn't the case - they establish relationships with fisherman or buy from the lcoal port's markets directly. I imagine the costs might also be reduced since costs don't accrue along the supply chain but the amount of resources that have gone into making the chain efficient pose a bit of an unknown factor. I'll have to look into this.</p> <p>You're especially in luck if you live in L.A., since many of these operations offer pickup and cheaper delivery. + the benefit of being the first port of entry for such products means less of a chance of your orders getting badly handled.</p> <ul> <li>Ugi Foods: They've got fish coming directly from Shimane Port and I think a partnership with Sol Japan and other wholesalers. I don't know how \"first pick\" the fish are and how reliable the selection is, though I imagine it's fairly decent. (Edit: A little diggin around and Nakaji seems to be coordinating with the folks at Sol Japan to source food from Shimane, so my bet is pretty damn good quality. Tetsu Sushi Bar in Vancouver also sources (possible non-exclusively - sushi bars often have multiple sources) from Sol Japan. This isn't on Sol Japan's blog, though I imagine it would be a good addition... @shimane_fish_love_japan seems to be the most active Sol Japan affilated instagram account.)</li> <li>Yokose Seafood (Toyama Bay): This is the U.S. output of Yokose, a wholesaler in Toyama Bay. Since it's a family business, and since the original business in Japan is quite sizable and handles distribution and packaging of locally sourced ingredients, I can imagine that the quality of the fish and handling is quite good, expecially for local Toyama Bay ingredients (buri, shiro ebi, hotaru ika - they take their pick at the Himi fish market).</li> </ul> <p>I think I'll try my hand at both.</p> <p>Sol Japan seems more aggressively pursuing U.S. distribution, however. Yokose is nearly a one man operation driven by the U.S.-based sons drive to establish operations out here.</p> <p>I feel that the U.S. side, for Yokose and Ugi, could be quite a bit more aggressive with a bit more slickness w.r.t to the DTC stuff. As for their restaurant operations, I'm not privy to them, though it seems they've got the incumbents of True World, Sakasyu, and Asahi Suisan to deal with. Ugi's operator posts a lot on his personal YouTube (quite a bit of business stuff, too), though it's entirely in Japanese. </p> <p>Edit: Yokose's socials and sites aren't often updated and the availability and hours are irregular (the proprietor does deliveries to restaurants), so it's best to give him a call. He seems like a sweetheart, though.</p> <p>I'm noticing a lot more home chefs going out of their way to get their hands on Japanese fish. Paying exorbitant prices. Getting into Sakasyu's WhatApp chats. Bugging the Chicago Mitsuwa's operations manager for a wholesale account. In Los Angeles food circles, people already know the names and signature products of farms by heart: Weiser Family Farms melons, Harry's Berries strawberries, Tutti Frutti heirloom tomatoes. With how quickly information propagates and becomes currency these days, I wouldn't be surprised if one of these wholesalers/distributors hits it big by distributing to the marginal enthusiast consumers at scale - though restaurants are typically the majority of these operation's' revenue. A good chunk of high end non-Japanese restaurants these days source Japanese fish, too, and I get the sense that that will be a growing trend (in and beyond the tier 1 places) - more so as the diners become aware of it. It's already been a trend, but the fact that I could find this information on distributors means the time is probably closer than ever - though r/sushi seems to be quite a bit behind... although it's likely due to budget constraints so can't blame them. Wondering if someone could convince Erewhon to establish relationships, even if to simply be pickup spots for these distributors. Or perhaps some of the more boutique shops? Perhaps a 99 Ranch or two out in affluent SGV? I can't imagine a lot of people in afluent LA proper would go out of their way to pick up out in Lomita or Gardena. Rather pay than drive. If any close to an American Kimagure Cook or Masuru comes around.... it'll be a sign.</p>","tags":["sourcing","food"]},{"location":"blog/2025/02/05/starting-the-blog/","title":"Starting the blog","text":"<p>I wanted to establish a single place to aggregate my interests and put them out in the \"open\".</p> <p>I also wanted a place where I could practice condensing my thoughts so I can hold onto them for longer and better communicate them.</p> <p>At the moment, I am: - learning Japanese - watching an unhealthy (?) amount of anime but not in a weird way, I hope - refining my restaurant search techniques - developing a perspective on food - cooking - trying to score a 177+ on the LSAT (lofty goals) - reaching for professional illustrator level in my free time</p>","tags":["slice of life"]},{"location":"blog/2025/02/10/sui-bot/","title":"Sui Bot","text":"<p>The single most intensive project I've undertaken is arbisui, a Sui DEX arbitrage bot.</p> <p>To be honest, the codebase is a mess outside of the tooling, and things could be done a hell of a lot better.
